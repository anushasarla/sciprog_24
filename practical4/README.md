## Practical 4

* This is the practical number 4. In this practical we have calculated the approximated area under the curve of the tangent function from 0 to 60 degrees using the Trapezoidal rule.

## To Compile:
```bash
gcc -o practical4 practical4 -lm
```

## To Execute:
```bash
./practical4
```

## Output:
TanArr[0] = 0.000000 
TanArr[1] = 0.087489
TanArr[2] = 0.176327
TanArr[3] = 0.267949
TanArr[4] = 0.363970
TanArr[5] = 0.466308
TanArr[6] = 0.577350
TanArr[7] = 0.700208
TanArr[8] = 0.839100
TanArr[9] = 1.000000
TanArr[10] = 1191754
TanArr[11] = 1.428148

Initial area (sum at x(0) and x(12)) = 0.000000 
The value of the sum after the loop is: 14.197204

Trapezoidal result is: 0.619470
Real result is: 0.693147
