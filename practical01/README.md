# Overview 
* These two programs are the most important and basic concepts of C programming.
* From "printing.c" we can print the output from a variable and from "scanning.c" we can take the input from the user and then print the output. 
* In C programming the function used to take the input from the user is:
```bash
scanf 
```
* In C programming the function used to print the output is:
```bash
printf
```
